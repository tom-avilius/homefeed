                Having purchased my first book, I went far and beyond to understand the core concepts involved
                with the discipline of programming. The book was detailed but for a 7th grader,
                that could not suffice, especially without a teacher. This was the point in my life 
                when I really started pushing myself. It took me 2 years to finally understand the core underlying 
                concepts in depth, giving me a strong foundation in understanding data, algorithms and
                programming paradigms.

                However, it was in class 9 that I became fully committed to coding. I went on to udemy and
                enrolled myself into various courses and completing the following not including the 
                other courses I am yet to complete:

                After finishing the web development course, I went on to take a break from udemy, creating
                a github account- I started to write open source software and websites with my primary 
                focus being the splash project. Along the way I picked up the electronJs framework,
                learning it to transform splash and other project into reality.
