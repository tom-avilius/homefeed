                Having purchased my first book, I went far and beyond to understand the core concepts involved
                with the discipline of programming. The book was detailed but for a 7th grader,
                that could not suffice, especially without a teacher. This was the point in my life 
                when I really started pushing myself. It took me 2 years to finally understand the core underlying 
                concepts in depth, giving me a strong foundation in understanding data, algorithms and
                programming paradigms.

                However, it was in class 9 that I became fully committed to coding. I went on to udemy and
                enrolled myself into various courses covering:
