                Having purchased my first book, I went far and beyond to understand the core concepts involved
                with the discipline of programming. The book was detailed but for a 7th grader,
                that could not suffice, especially without a teacher. This was the point in my life 
                when I really started pushing myself. It took me 2 years to finally understand the core underlying 
                concepts in depth, giving me a strong foundation in understanding data, algorithms and
                programming paradigms.

                However, it was in class 9 that I became fully committed to coding. I went on to udemy and
                enrolled myself into various courses and completing the following not including the 
                other courses I am yet to complete:

                After finishing the web development course, I went on to take a break from udemy, creating
                a github account- I started to write open source software and websites with my primary 
                focus being the splash project. Along the way I picked up the electronJs framework,
                learning it to transform splash and other projects into reality.

                Working on individual projects to bring my ideas into reality gave me both experience 
                and confidence needed to be a developer which I would love to share with you as I 
                highlight some of my work below:

                <dd> <p class="about-p">
                    I had this project in my mind ever since I started learning html, css; to be
                    able to create themes for the desktop screen using the web technologies, making 
                    it easier for everyone to create and use powerful and productive themes very easily.
                    Unlike rainmeter which uses lua, this project uses html, css and javascript: clearly
                    defining structure, style and behaviour separately.  
                    <br>
                    I have also written several APIs that would make development with splash much easier
                    while at the same I've taken great care in documenting the application and it's APIs.
                    <br>
                    Splash uses electronJS framework. It was my first time using electronJS and I certainly
                    did encounter various hurdles but in the end I did create something unique and original.
                    The happiness that one receives after being able to create his own product overrides all 
                    the hardships.

                    I designed this to be a theme for Winter's Kiss serving both the user and 
                    as an example for all those who aspire to write themes for splash.

                    user defines.
