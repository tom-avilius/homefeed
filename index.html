            I am a student in my final school year. My passion towards computers and language
            has driven me to write code and poems. I have worked on a number of projects that use 
            html, css, javascript and python. I've been sharing my poems on pinterest and via various 
            publications. You may also find me using my pen name, 'tom avilius' in a number of my works.

          <p class="about-p">I started my journey towards coding when I was in 7th standard by
            purchasing the book, 'A First Course in Programming with C'. Although I did not 
            study the C language in depth, it did introduce me to the marvellous world of coding.
            Understanding that coding is a relentless journey, I went on to Udemy to complete courses
            on html, css, javascript, python and git along with other courses having varying degrees of completion.

                I have been an avid writer, writing poems and sending them to various publications.

          <p class="about-p">
            Alongside coding, I developed my poetic skills from expressing love to exploring mystique
            and nature. This eventually led me into maintaining journals where I would write
            poems, paraphrases, stories and express ideas. It gives comfort and time to reflect
            upon myself as a personal niche which it was up until recently when I started
            sending my poems to various publications and sharing them on the internet
